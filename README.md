UNLIMITED ARMAMENT WORKS
</h1> 

<div align="center">

My first java mod, a continuation
of [Heavy Armaments Industries](https://github.com/Eschatologue/Heavy-Armaments-Industries), all future content will be
implemented here instead of the old repository.

**Unlimited Armament Works**, which the name obviously not inspired by a certain anime title, is both a port and a
sequel to **Heavy Armament Industries**.

Featuring contents that expands upon vanilla Mindustry, adding more turrets, units, factories, and much more that meant
to be played side by side with vanilla Mindustry.

## Building for Desktop Testing
1. Install JDK 17.
2. Run `gradlew jar` [1].
3. Your mod jar will be in the build/libs directory. Only use this version for testing on desktop. It will not work with Android. To build an [Android-compatible version](##Building Locally), you need the **Android SDK**. You can either let Github Actions handle this, or set it up yourself. See steps below.

## Building through Github Actions

This repository is set up with Github Actions CI to automatically build the mod for you every commit. This requires a
Github repository, for obvious reasons. To get a jar file that works for every platform, do the following:

1. Make a Github repository with your mod name, and upload the contents of this repo to it. Perform any modifications
   necessary, then commit and push.
2. Check the "Actions" tab on your repository page. Select the most recent commit in the list. If it completed
   successfully, there should be a download link under the "Artifacts" section.
3. Click the download link (should be the name of your repo). This will download a **zipped jar** - **not** the jar file
   itself [2]! Unzip this file and import the jar contained within in Mindustry. This version should work both on
   Android and Desktop.

## Building Locally

Building locally takes more time to set up, but shouldn't be a problem if you've done Android development before.

1. Download the Android SDK, unzip it and set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to its location.
2. Make sure you have API level 30 installed, as well as any recent version of build tools (e.g. 30.0.1)
3. Add a build-tools folder to your PATH. For example, if you have `30.0.1` installed, that would
   be `$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/30.0.1`.
4. Run `gradlew deploy`. If you did everything correctlly, this will create a jar file in the `build/libs` directory
   that can be run on both Android and desktop.

*[1]* *On Linux/Mac it's `./gradlew`, but if you're using Linux I assume you know how to run executables properly
anyway.*  
*[2]: Yes, I know this is stupid. It's a Github UI limitation - while the jar itself is uploaded unzipped, there is
currently no way to download it as a single file.*
